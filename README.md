EmailValidation
===============

A simple (but correct) .NET class for validating email addresses.

Supports mail addresses as defined in rfc5322 as well as the new Internationalized Mail Address standards (rfc653x).

# Other Implementations:

If you need an implementation in something other than C#, perhaps Pavel Azenov's [javascript port](https://github.com/azanov/emailValidator) will be helpful.
